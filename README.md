# divi-website-customizations
Code for custom elements, functions, animations, etc. in websites I have built for Tucker CM Digital

This repository contains code I have implemented into websites built on Wordpress under the Divi theme. As such, the code will not function if cloned as it will not be located in the environment they have been utilized in.

I am using this repository mainly to easily implement past concepts into future projects and to show that I am capable of software development.
